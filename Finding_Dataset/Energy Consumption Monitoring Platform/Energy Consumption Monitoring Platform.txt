Energy Consumption Monitoring Platform (Idea in Simple Words)
This project is about tracking how much electricity people are using â€”
in homes, offices, malls, and other places â€” in real-time.

We want to:

Collect electricity usage data (how much power people are consuming at different locations).

Store that data safely.

Analyze it to find interesting patterns, like:

When people use the most electricity (morning, evening, summer, winter).

Which areas use more energy (for example, malls may use more AC in summer).

Detect if thereâ€™s unusual electricity usage (maybe due to a faulty machine?).

Show this data in beautiful dashboards (graphs, charts) â€” so city managers, companies, and even citizens can see and understand the energy situation easily.

ðŸ›  How will we build this platform?
Here's the step-by-step:


Step	What will happen?
â¿¡	Create fake electricity data using Python (simulate real meter readings)
â¿¢	Upload this data into S3 (Amazonâ€™s cloud storage)
â¿£	Use AWS Glue to clean and organize this data into different layers (like raw, clean, curated)
â¿¤	Use EMR (Elastic MapReduce) and PySpark to analyze large amounts of data, and detect any weird energy usage
â¿¥	Use Athena and Redshift to query and summarize the data (for example, find daily/monthly usage per area)
â¿¦	Build a dashboard in Tableau or Power BI to visualize everything easily
â¿§	Use AWS Lambda to automatically trigger actions whenever new data comes in
â¿¨	Use Git to manage code versions and track changes made to ETL scripts
ðŸ“ˆ Why is this project important?
Helps cities manage electricity better and prevent blackouts.

Helps people and companies save money by understanding their power usage.

Supports green energy efforts by reducing wastage.

Shows how cloud + big data + data visualization can work together in real life.

ðŸŒŸ In Short:
"We are building a smart system to monitor, analyze, and visualize how electricity is being used across a city â€” using Cloud, Big Data, andÂ ModernÂ Tools."
